        <p class="h4">About</p>
        
    <p class="lead">London Rent Hacker started as a hobby project. After spending three years living in Stoke Newington and commuting to work in Leyton, I thought I had my finances worked out. However, after moving to Leyton and paying £50 more on rent I suddenly found myself with way more money left over at the end of the month. It was then I realised that I had been spending a ridiculous amout of money a month on travel.<br><br> Rent and travel costs can be both confusing and crippling in London, especially for new arrivals. The premise behind London Rent Hacker is to give a helping had to those looking to stream-line their monthly costs and not make the same mistakes I did. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="h4">How it Works</p>
        <p>Inner London has been broken down into 121 wards. Most of them match the names of the actual wards of London. However some of them have been grouped together to make things easier (particularly around the city). <br> When you search for your place of employment, the result is marked on the map with a "w", the polygon this point falls inside is then identified as your "work polygon" the travel times and costs from the centre of your work polygon to the centre of every other polygon on the map. This gives you a rough indication of the cost and travel times to any place within any polygon in london. <br> The travel cost is then added to the median rent for a one bedroom house within each polygon to get a "gross cost" the polygon with the lowest gross cost is then suggested to you, with some important facts and crime figures.<br>The crime figures are taken from <a href="https://data.police.uk/">data.police.uk</a> which provides a fantastic wealth of data related to crime for any point around the country.<br> The house price data was collected manually and is currently static. The map itself is powered by a combination of google fusion tables and google maps and their associated, <a href="https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/sample_code">fabulously powerful API</a>. The transport data was taken from <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk/">TFL's API.</a>. Since TFL isn't able to calculate fares for regionaly train travel within London (for example, the quickest route from Richmond to Waterloo) all regional trains were calcualted at their average of £3.00. As a result, travel data, in its current form, is not entirely accurate.  </p>
        <br>
        <p class="h4">Future Features</p>
   <p>As it currently stands, London Rent Hacker works very well, but could afford some improvements. Here's a list in more or less chronological order of planned future improvements.</p>
    <ul class="to-do">
        <li><b>Re-do the back-end calculations to improve speed and optimisation.</b><br> The lag time is currently almost half a second.</li>
        <li><b>split the polygons into smaller sections for searching for work places.</b><br> This will give a more accurate value for commute times.</li>
        <li><b>Improve the travel cost calculations.</b><br> The travel cost calculation does not accurately calculate regional rail travel. Neither does it take into account fare-capping. I would also like to add the option in the future to select a method of paying (Oyster-card, Travel-card, contactless etc).</li>
        <li><b>Improve the housing code</b><br> Currently, the housing cost only takes into consideration one bedroom flats. In theory this gives an accurate representation of general property prices throughout the capital. However I would like to give the option to choose property type in the future.</li>
        <li><b>Link to available properties in the area you are interested in</b><br> This would be part of improvements to the housing code. Perhaps involving a partnership with an estate agency.</li>
    </ul>
